    <li class="text"> 
        An easy way to think of a derivative is the change of rate. 
        For example, velocity is the change of position over time. Velocity is also the derivative of position.
        Look at this graph below.

        <b id="important">To find the velocity during a time interval you need to calculate the slope.</b>
        Take the change of position and divide it by the change of time.
        From 0 to 1 seconds, the position remains at 20 meters. The average velocity during this interval
        is 0 m/s.
    </li>
    <li class="text">
        From 1 to 3 seconds, the position increases from 20 meters to 60 meters. What is the average velocity during this period?
